## Unity Platformer {#header-title}

<p id="header-text">
I created a couple substances with as inspiration of the roman times, and looking at what things are popular in games. During the roman times chainmail armor was really common and I was super interested in making it as a substance. And when my mind went to the weapons they would use back then, I was interested in making the metal substance. I quickly found out however  that this would be too easy, so I decided to try to make animated substances instead, in the form of waving grass. A wooden substance for the weapon handles. and dragons, because who doesnâ€™t like dragons in their games. And leather because it is a common material for generic armor.

## What was this project about? {#about-title}

<p id="about-text">
I created this project as a professional portfolio item for a university module. In this module we have to create learning outcomes. Of these learning outcomes we need to state what we are going to make to achieve them. I decided that i wanted to learn adobe substance 3D designer. And make 5 substances using this program. My other project for the same module were 5 visual effects. But they deserve their own page.
