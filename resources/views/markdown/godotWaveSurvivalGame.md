## What was this project about? {#about-title}

<p id="about-text">
I created this project as a professional portfolio item for a university module. in this module we have to create learning outcomes. of these learning outcomes we need to state what we are going to make to achieve them. I decided that i wanted to create a wave survival game in the Godot game engine. To create this game I also used the programming language that comes with the game engine called GDscript.
