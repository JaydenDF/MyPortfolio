## Unreal zombies survival {#header-title}

<p id="header-text">
I created my first ever project within unreal engine. one of the games i have enjoyed most in my life is Call of Duty: zombies. This is for me a save fall back to recreate within new software. It has a solid foundation of what it covers when it comes to game features. I have created similar projects like this within Unity and Godot before. In my opinion this project turned out to be the most polished project i managed to create as a solo developer even though it is my first project within unreal engine. this project was created using the blueprints system that is build in unreal engine. This made it quite easy to make it this polished. In the future i would love to recreate this project but with the c++ programming language inside of unreal engine.

## What was this project about? {#about-title}

<p id="about-text">
I created this project as a professional portfolio item for a university module. In this module we have to create learning outcomes. Of these learning outcomes we need to state what we are going to make to achieve them. I decided that i wanted to learn unreal engine, and the blueprints programming system that is build into it. The product that i wanted to create is a zombie survival game with waves that increasingly get harder. The enemies hit harder and faster every round. And the zombies also get more health every round. I also managed to create shooting, reloading, aiming, and buying items, which for now only consists of a door that opens a new area. Artistic assets are taken from the library and other platforms.
