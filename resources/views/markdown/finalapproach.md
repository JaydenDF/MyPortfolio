## Final Approach {#header-title}

<p id="header-text">
Houston we have a problem is a game concept created for project final approach, this project we had to create a game concept of a physics based puzzle game, our idea for this game was to make a gun which the player can aim towards the ground and repel themselves into the sky, the name came from the idea that the player is an astronaut and his spaceship was wrecked.</p>

## My role in this project {#about-title}

<p id="about-text">
This project we had less time to make a final product than other projects, and because of that we as engineers had to plan our time carefully, physics was a big part of this project and the other engineer was mostly working on the physics of the game while I was writing the code for all the other functionalities.</p>
