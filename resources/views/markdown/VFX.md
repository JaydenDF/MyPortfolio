## Unity Platformer {#header-title}

<p id="header-text">
I created a couple Visual effects, I didn't have a specific inspiration for these visual effects. I just wanted to make some effects that were pretty fundamental and would teach me a lot. I created a visual effect that would follow a path, an effect like this could be used for a lot of things. similarly, a visual effect that uses a mesh, so it can follow the player or an npc. one visual effect is inspired by the Mandalorian, the disintegration effect. furthermore i made a lightning effect and a classic magic orb.

## What was this project about? {#about-title}

<p id="about-text">
I created this project as a Professional portfolio item for a university module, in this module we have to create learning outcomes, of these learning outcomes we need to state what we are going to make to achieve them. I decided that I wanted to learn Unity's VFX Graph. And create 5 Visual effects to learn this system. My other project for the same module were 5 Substance. But they deserve their own page.
