<p id="header-text">
Stella rush is the game my group created for project lift off, project liftoff was a project about making an arcade game and creating our own controller along with it the designers were responsible for the controller, the artists for the art and the engineers to make the game work, I was lucky to get an awesome group during this project and was an awesome project overall.</p>

## My role in this project {#about-title}

<p id="about-text">
Our group first decided to make an arcade racing game but later on decided that it was not possible for us to make because we needed to know about physics which we a course we didn’t had yet, our second and final idea was a wave based protection game, our group had 2 engineers me and Jan, I was responsible for the enemies and the wave system which worked pretty good for the short time we had and I regularly use that same wave system for other projects.</p>
