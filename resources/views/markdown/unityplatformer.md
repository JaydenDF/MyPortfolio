## Unity Platformer {#header-title}

<p id="header-text">
Unity platformer is a platformer that I made with unity, it isn't finished yet since I only have the mechanics and no levels. I am going to work on the levels in the future and try finishing this game as much as possible. I have made documentation of my code.</p>

## What was this project about? {#about-title}

<p id="about-text">
I created this project as a Professional portfolio item for a university module, in this module we have to create learning outcomes, of these learning outcomes we need to state what we are going to make to achieve them. I decided that I wanted to create a platformer in unity to develop my programming skills and game developing skills. my other learning outcome is about documenting. I wanted to document my code on a level that it would be readable and usable for my peers.</p>
